# Client-Server Lab: RMHS Wordle Revisited

> NOTE: Save this notebook under a new folder `Documents` > `html-lab-two`.

During our last web development lab, we [remade Wordle](https://github.com/ianfisk/teaching-materials/tree/main/wordle/part-one) by writing a **local HTML file** (_local_ meaning the file is saved to our computer's hard drive) and opening that local file in Chrome on our computers. Our Wordle file contained all the HTML, CSS (`<style>` elements), and JS (`<script>` elements) we needed, all in one file. Pretty cool!

Now we're going to update our website to resemble a real internet site: **_A web page hosted on a web server and accessed over the internet._**

To get started, save the Jupyter Notebook file, `wordle-client-server.ipynb`, to a new `Documents/html-lab-two` folder, and open the file in Jupyter Notebooks. All further instructions are provided there.
