# Drawing with Turtles üê¢

In this lab you will explore the following concepts:
- Using for loops in Python
- Using an object (a Turtle) in Python
- Using some mathematical thinking to solve a problem
- Having fun with code

## Task

Write a program that uses for loops and Turtles to draw the following shapes:

1. Triangle (done in class)
1. Square: 4 sides
1. Pentagon: 5 sides
1. Hexagon: 6 sides
1. Heptagon: 7 sides
1. Octagon: 8 sides

Your program must have your **name, date, and a description** comment at the top. E.g.,

```
# Ian Fisk
# 6/6/2024
# Description: This is an example program header.
```

## Deliverables

1. Program design flowchart (or similar skeleton structure)
1. Python program created from your design outline

TODO(ianfisk): Add rubric here

## Tips

You may use **one** turtle to draw all shapes in one spot on the screen so they are overlapping, or choose to structure your program so the shapes are not overlapping by moving your turtle around. The world is your oyster!

TODO(ianfisk): Add picture of example output

## Optional Extensions

- Generalize your code so turn angles and shapes are calculated dynamically based on the number of sides of the shape.

- Create and use **multiple** turtle objects to draw one of the shapes. Additional turtles can fill the shape in some way, add other artistic flare, etc. (Advanced application on the rubric)

- Accept user input in your program that allows the user to specify the number of sides of a polygon they want drawn, or input that allows them to pick froma set of polygons.

- Draw a classic 5-point star with a turtle. Can you fill it with color?

- Draw me something appropriate using turtles and for loops that you find interesting or beautiful! Try to use multiple colors in your drawing

- If you did the assignment in Jupyter or another online interface, can you copy your code to a file and execute the program from the command line?
